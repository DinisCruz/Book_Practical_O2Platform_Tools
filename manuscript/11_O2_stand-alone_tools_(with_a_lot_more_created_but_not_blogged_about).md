##  11 O2 stand-alone tools (with a lot more created but not blogged about) 

As part of the [new design](http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2012/11/new-design-for-this-blog.html) of this blog, I just cleaned up a bit the [O2 Platform Tools](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/O2%20Platform%20Tool) Label/Page, and here are the 11 that have been published so far:

Btw, **there are a lot more tools** (i.e. O2 *.h2 scripts) that I have created but have not had the time to write a blog post about.

  


If you are looking for a particular script or tool, take a [look at this public dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xu90yd334ig0n7x/FU4ry6zemj/O2Platform%20Tools)

**Question: **As I asked in [Should I start an O2 based 'A-Tool-a-Day' blog?](http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2012/10/should-i-start-o2-based-tool-day-blog.html)  , **anybody has some cycles to help with this?**

  


Maybe we could do something like the old SysInternals website? Which was a big collection of Mark's tools filtered by type and target audience. Btw here are the (pre-Microsoft acquisition) exes/source-code of the original sysinternals tools: [http://court.shrock.org/sysinternals/](http://court.shrock.org/sysinternals/) )
