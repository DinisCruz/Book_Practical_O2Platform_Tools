##  Util - O2 Java Tools (IKVM Based) v1.0

These tools leverage the amazing [IKVM ](http://www.ikvm.net/)project to parse the Java class files into C# classes.

You can download the exe from [Util - O2 Java Tools - IKVM Based v1.0.exe](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/81532342/O2Platform%20Tools/Java/Util%20-%20O2%20Java%20Tools%20-%20IKVM%20Based%20v1.0.exe) (its 20Mb since it includes the latest version of IKVM)

**Included REPL Script environment**
