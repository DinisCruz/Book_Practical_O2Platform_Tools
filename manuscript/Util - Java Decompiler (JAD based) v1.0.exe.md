##  Util - Java Decompiler (JAD based) v1.0.exe 

If you want to take a quick look at the Java code inside a Jar file, here is a simple Java/Jar Decompiler (based on [the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAD_(JAva_Decompiler)) [JAD](http://www.varaneckas.com/jad/) tool)

You can download the tool from: [Util - Java Decompiler (JAD based) v1.0.exe](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/81532342/O2Platform%20Tools/Java/Util%20-%20Java%20Decompiler%20%28JAD%20based%29%20v1.0.exe) (stand-alone O2 Platform script)  


This is what it looks like when you open it:

And this is what happens after a *.jar file is dropped in the left-hand-side TreeView:

You can drop multiple jar files:

Apart the initial delay (caused by the unziping of the dropped jar file into a temp folder), the decompilation should be quite quick.
