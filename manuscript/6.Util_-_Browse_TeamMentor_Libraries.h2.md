##  Util - Browse TeamMentor Libraries.h2 

Here is another simple tool that allows for a quick browse of TeamMentor Articles (download exe from: [Util - Browse TeamMentor Libraries v1.0.exe](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/n2nkpfo8ie5q8dd/Util%20-%20Browse%20TeamMentor%20Libraries%20v1.0.exe) )

The objective of this tool is to show how to mass consume TeamMentor Articles (if you look at the code you will notice that all metadata will be downloaded locally so that after an initial delay, all navigation happens in real time (with the articles being downloaded on demand).

Note that that there is a more advanced version of this tool (called [Library Manager](https://github.com/TeamMentor/UnitTests/blob/master/LibraryManagement/TM%20-%20Library%20Manager%20(with%20REPL)%20v1.2.3.h2)), but for local access and quick views of TeamMentor Libraries, this is quite a nice tool:

  
This is what the tools looks like:

There is a right-mouse-click context menu (on the Server TextBox) that allows you to change servers

And a 'Reload Libraries' context menu on the Library tree that will clear the local cache and reload the TeamMentor GuiObjects.

The object viewer on the right shows the Metadata available on each TeamMentor article:

For best results use a local instance of TeamMentor, and if you get an error like this, it means the account you tried to use failed to login:
