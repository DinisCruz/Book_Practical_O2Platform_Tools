##  Util - Windows Handles Viewer (Simple GUI with REPL) v1.0.exe 

Based on the [Util - Windows Handles Viewer (Simple Gui) v1.0.exe](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/util-windows-handles-viewer-simple-gui.html) tool, here is a bigger version (5Mbs) which contains a C# REPL Script editor (with the detected handle provided as a parameter).

You can get this version from [Util - Windows Handles Viewer (Simple GUI with REPL) v1.0.exe](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/81532342/O2Platform%20Tools/Windows/Windows_Messages/Util%20-%20Windows%20Handles%20Viewer%20%28Simple%20GUI%20with%20REPL%29%20v1.0.exe)  


And this is what the default GUI looks like:

To try out the C# REPL , drag the _Target Icon _into the TextBox below (shown in red below)

Then un-comment the line below Task #1 and click on Execute (note how the TextBox value was changed)

To see how you can also change the text of a Handle whose value you discovered, use the Handle value (in this case 657236) in the code (replacing 12345 as mentioned in the Task #2 instructions) and click execute:

And as shown in [Util - Windows Handles Viewer (Simple Gui) v1.0.exe](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/util-windows-handles-viewer-simple-gui.html) , this will work on other windows and processes :)
